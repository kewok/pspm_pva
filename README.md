# Project Description

The code base for "Analyzing how habitat degradation drives extinction dynamics using physiologically-structured population models". To compile the code, run the Makefile in the main directory and the Makefile in Examples/WaniPVA. For dependencies, refer to [the main sPEGG repository](https://github.com/kewok/spegg). 

R scripts to generate the configuration files for the scenarios analysed in the manuscript are found in the Examples/WaniPVA/configFileGenerator directory. An R script to handle running the simulation using the compiled executable is in Examples/WaniPVA/Repeater.R
